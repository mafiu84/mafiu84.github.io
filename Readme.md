# The Monkees website

Stream One Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

Website about band The Monkees. History of band, some pictures, music and videoclip as well as contact form to message group regarding events. 

## DEMO



## UX

### User stories

As a fan of group i want to see news about group and listen to their music

As an event organizer I want to have possibility to listen to music of group and contact if I'm interested in cooperation  

### Strategy

My goal was to build mobile friendly, responsive website with all the information easily accessible from navbar on large screens and drop down menu on mobile devices.

### Scope

For fans, I wanted to provide them with all the news about group, and media to look at.

For people interested in cooperation, I wanted to provide possibility to contact group.

### Structure

In contact page I wanted to provide not only contact form but links to all social media accounts to maximize the fan base. YouTube subscription link is provided in footer on every page  and footer stays collapsed regardless to screen size for easy acces.

### Skeleton



### Surface

Background pictures in landing page, music, video and contact page were edited in fotor app that they would not distract attention from the content.

## TECHNOLOGIES

HTML - Hypertext Markup Language - used for building basic structure of website, allows to view it on modern web brosers [official description](https://whatwg.org/)

CSS - Cascading Style Sheets - adding styles to website like fonts, colours, layout etc. [official description](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/)

Bootstrap 3.3.7 - library that I've used to build responsive grid layout and as base for some smaller elements available [here](https://getbootstrap.com/)

Font Awesome - I've used this library to get icons and social websites logos available [here](https://fontawesome.com/)

Additional fonts from Google Fonts library (Carter One, Source Sans Pro) available [here](https://fonts.google.com/)

Fotor - photo editing app, to edit background pictures, downloaded from [here](https://www.fotor.com/windows/index.html)

## FEATURES

YouTube link is implemented on every site in container on bottom and its always visible as it scrolls with website. On contact page there are all link to social media of the band. Sites are responsive and on mobile screens there is drop down menu instead of navbar to get better clarity of content.

### Features left to implement

In future I would like to add online shop to sell items related to the group.

## TESTING

HTML tested in official validator
CSS tested in official validator
Also I've tested website in chrome devtools for responsiveness and on multiple browsers and mobile devices. 

## DEPLOYMENT

## CREDITS

### Content

As content i used Lorem ipsum text to complete the contents if necessary. 

### Media

All photos re from stock libraries and edited in Fotor app to keep the color theme of the page. Theme is dark bacause it reduces the luminance emitted by device screens, while still meeting minimum color contrast ratios. It helps improve visual ergonomics by reducing eye strain, adjusting brightness to current lighting conditions, and facilitating screen use in dark environments â€“ all while conserving battery power.

### Acknowledgements

Band logo working as link to landing page was inspired by official website of group [official site](https://www.monkees.com/).
